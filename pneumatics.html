                    Industrial Pneumatics deals with the use of compressed air to execute mechanized tasks in industry. Pneumatics is used in those applications where high-speed movement (linear or rotary) with low to medium force is required. Where conventional AC/DC Motors
                    and other electrical equipment can’t be used or are less suitable, pneumatics is the technology of choice. Training in Industrial pneumatics aims to familiarize participants with the design, construction and operation of pneumatic
                    components in industrial applications.

                    We are a group of expert professionals and technocrats from various fields of Science & Technology who have come together on this unique platform with the aim of providing high quality Trainings & Consultancy services at affordable costs. Our team consists
                    of highly experienced professionals from industry and academia having many years of rich experience in their respective fields. There is a large gap between the technical competence of a freshly passed out graduate Engineer and the
                    technical expertise required by the industry. The industrial requirements are all together different than what is taught in the Engineering/Technology Degree/Diploma programs in various institutions. That’s why 80% of the fresh graduates
                    that pass out do not find suitable jobs and have to depend upon the campus placements, job fairs, placement agencies, etc to get a job for themselves. Thus, there is a requirement for a specialized training which can bridge the gap,
                    so that freshly passed out Engineering graduates can become ‘Industry Ready’. Our trainings are designed to achieve this goal of making students Industry Ready. We have an extensive network of industry professionals, consultants and
                    analysts who regularly provide us with the information about the latest trends of technological innovations happening in the industry and the technical expertise required for that. According to that feedback, our course contents for
                    various trainings are updated regularly. We ensure that our students get the most advanced and latest stuff so that they become confident and can get a suitable job of their own wish. Additionally, we do help (mentor) our students
                    undergoing training in their assignments and project work. Our trainings are job-oriented & we also help our students to get jobs through our Job Placement Assistance services free of cost. We try to ensure that our trained students
                    get quality jobs which help them grow in their professional careers. All our team members are highly enthusiastic and passionate about their work and do their best to deliver high quality of trainings and services. All our students
                    get exclusive personalized attention, which help them learn the concepts at their own pace, with a solid foundation. So why wait? Have a look on our training programs & other consultancy services that we offer and choose what suits
                    you the best! Don’t forget to book a free Demonstration session with our training expert before joining the training of your choice. We also undertake on-site training programs for academia as well as corporate environments. We also
                    provide consultancy services in the field of IT and automation. We help our clients in product development, prototyping, automation, experimental setups for measurement of physical quantities, testing machines and special purpose machines.
